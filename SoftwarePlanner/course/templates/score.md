### Scoring

The grade you will get for this task will be determined by the number of 
key requirements that you meet.

The score will be calculated as...

10 points total for {{ goal }}
{% for r in requirements %}
* 2 points for {{ r }}{% endfor %} 

Two points will be given for each minor deliverable.  If you partially meet the
requirement you will be given 1 point for trying.  Work must be completed by the
deadline.  No late work will be graded.
